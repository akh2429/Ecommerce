E-commerce Website (Frontend + Backend)

I have built an e-commerce website using the React library for the frontend and the Express framework for the backend. The website provides users with an interactive interface to browse and purchase products. Here are the features and technologies used in this project:



Frontend:

The frontend is built using the React library, which allows for a dynamic and efficient user interface.
The React Router DOM library is utilized for single-page UI navigation, connecting multiple pages such as the login page, sign-up page, cart page, landing page, product landing page, and product display page.
The Redux library is implemented to manage the state of the application, including storing logged-in user data and product data.
The Axios library is used to make HTTP requests to the backend RESTful APIs.
The cart page is implemented with functionalities for adding, removing, and updating cart items.
The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on various devices.


Backend:

The backend is built using the Express framework, which provides a robust and scalable server-side architecture.
RESTful APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are integrated into the backend using the Axios library to handle requests from the frontend.
The MongoDB Atlas cloud database is utilized for data storage. It provides a reliable and scalable solution for storing product information, user data, and other relevant details.
A localhost server is set up to connect the frontend with the backend, ensuring smooth communication between the two components.
Protected routing is implemented from the frontend to the backend to ensure secure access to certain pages and resources.
Deployment:

The e-commerce website is deployed using the Netlify platform. The deployment link for the website is:

Overall, this e-commerce website provides users with a seamless shopping experience, incorporating essential features such as user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and secure transactions.
